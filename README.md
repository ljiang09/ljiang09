# Hi, I'm Lily Jiang.

I'm a sophomore at Olin College in Needham, MA. I'm pursuing a degree in Engineering with Computing,
where I focus a lot on software development and deployment.

I'm super interested in front-end web and app development, which I'm exploring as a cofounder of [Sebela](https://www.sebela.co).
